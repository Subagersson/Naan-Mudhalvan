The Lease Management System (LMS) is a software solution designed to automate and manage the entire lifecycle of lease agreements, from initiation to termination. In this project, we are implementing a Lease Management System using Salesforce to manage lease data, automate business processes, and ensure compliance and accuracy throughout the lease lifecycle. This system will serve industries that lease properties, equipment, or vehicles, enabling them to streamline their operations, enhance decision-making, and improve overall efficiency. Salesforce, as a customer relationship management (CRM) platform, offers extensive capabilities for customization and automation that make it an ideal solution for managing lease agreements and workflows.
